# SC/CE/CZ2002: Object-Oriented Design & Programming Project 
This project focuses on developing a software application for the Housing and Development Board (HDB) system, specifically for managing Build-to-Order (BTO) applications and project registrations. This system aims to streamline the process of handling BTO applications, from submission to project management, containing 3 roles of users: Applicants/Officers and Managers

## Objectives
The main objective of this assignment is
- to apply the Object-Oriented (OO) concepts you have learnt in the course,
- to model, design and develop an OO application.
- to gain familiarity with using Java as an object-oriented programming
language.
- to work collaboratively as a group to achieve a common goal. 

## Deliverables

### UML Class Diagram 
A detailed UML Class Diagram for the application (exported as an image)
- Show clearly the class relationship, notation
- Annotate your UML diagram to highlight where specific OO principles (e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism) are applied. 


### UML Sequence Diagram
A detailed UML Sequence Diagram (exported as an image)
- The diagram should show clearly all participating objects involved with sufficient detailed flow and relevant interaction fragments.


### Report
#### Report should contain:
UML Class Diagram:
- Show the class relationships and apply appropriate notations.
- Include notes to explain the diagram, highlighting specific Object-Oriented (OO) principles (e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism).

#### UML Sequence Diagram
- Detail the flow of interactions for the HDB Officer's role in applying for a Build-to-Order (BTO) and registering to handle a project.

#### Additional Features/Functionalities
- Highlight any extra features added to the system.

#### Design Considerations
- Discuss the OO concepts used, the designâ€™s extensibility, and maintainability.
- Reflect on trade-offs made in design choices and how design patterns were applied. Include alternative patterns considered and the reasoning behind your final choice.

#### Reflection
- Share any difficulties encountered, the knowledge learned, and suggestions for improvement based on experience.

#### GitHub Repository
- Provide a link to your GitHub repository with all relevant files and code.

##### Declaration of Original Work:
- Include a signed Declaration form confirming original work (Appendix B).
