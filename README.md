# SC/CE/CZ2002: Object-Oriented Design & Programming Project 
This project focuses on developing a software application for the Housing and Development Board (HDB) system, specifically for managing Build-to-Order (BTO) applications and project registrations. This system aims to streamline the process of handling BTO applications, from submission to project management, containing 3 roles of users: Applicants/Officers and Managers

## Objectives
The main objective of this assignment is
- to apply the Object-Oriented (OO) concepts you have learnt in the course,
- to model, design and develop an OO application.
- to gain familiarity with using Java as an object-oriented programming
language.
- to work collaboratively as a group to achieve a common goal. 

## Deliverables

### UML Class Diagram 
A detailed UML Class Diagram for the application (exported as an image)
- Show clearly the class relationship, notation
- Annotate your UML diagram to highlight where specific OO principles (e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism) are applied. 


### UML Sequence Diagram
A detailed UML Sequence Diagram (exported as an image)
- The diagram should show clearly all participating objects involved with sufficient detailed flow and relevant interaction fragments.


### Report
#### Report should contain:
UML Class Diagram:
- Show the class relationships and apply appropriate notations.
- Include notes to explain the diagram, highlighting specific Object-Oriented (OO) principles (e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism).

#### UML Sequence Diagram
- Detail the flow of interactions for the HDB Officer's role in applying for a Build-to-Order (BTO) and registering to handle a project.

#### Additional Features/Functionalities
- Highlight any extra features added to the system.

#### Design Considerations
- Discuss the OO concepts used, the design’s extensibility, and maintainability.
- Reflect on trade-offs made in design choices and how design patterns were applied. Include alternative patterns considered and the reasoning behind your final choice.

#### Reflection
- Share any difficulties encountered, the knowledge learned, and suggestions for improvement based on experience.

#### GitHub Repository
- Provide a link to your GitHub repository with all relevant files and code.

##### Declaration of Original Work:
- Include a signed Declaration form confirming original work (Appendix B).


## DEMOSTRATION & PRESENTATION (Deadline: Week 14 Friday, 11:59pm)
Your group is required to present your work to your TA to demonstrate the working of the application – presenting ALL the required functionalities of the
application. It is advised that you planned your demonstration in a storyboarding flow to facilitate understanding of your application. Please introduce your members and group number at the start of presentation, all the group members must take turn to present. The presenter should show his/her face while presenting.
In the production, you may include:
- Explaining essential and relevant information about the application
- Run-through and elaborate on essential part/s of your implementation/coding

Presentation is 15min total, font must be large enough and the demo is to be done in real time not prerun display. 

<p style='red;'> Repository is to be submitted one day before presentation with TA </p>
